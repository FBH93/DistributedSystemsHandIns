There are different levels that you can work on. In order to pass, you need to implement at least (1) or (2).

(1)[Easy] implement TCP/IP using threads. This is not realistic (since the protocol should run across a network) but your implementation needs to show that you have a good understanding of the protocol.

(2)[Hard] implement a TCP/IP using the net package or GRPC (https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

(3)[Medium] implement a forwarder process/thread that simulates the middleware, where messages can be delayed or lost. All messages must go through the forwarder if you go for this option. 


Attach to your submission, a *README* file answering the following questions:
    a) What are packages in your implementation? What data structure do you use to transmit data and meta-data?
    b) Does your implementation use threads or processes? Why is it not realistic to use threads?
    c) How do you handle message re-ordering?
    d) How do you handle message loss?
    e) Why is the 3-way handshake important?
